# 🧠 QuizTube: Transforming YouTube Videos into Quizzes with Streamlit

QuizTube offers an innovative approach to create interactive quizzes from YouTube video captions. By extracting captions using the [`youtube-transcript-api`](https://github.com/jdepoix/youtube-transcript-api) and subsequently processing the text with OpenAI's LLM, `QuizTube` serves as a powerful tool for enhancing video content interaction.

## How It Works

1. **Caption Extraction:** Using the [`youtube-transcript-api`](https://github.com/jdepoix/youtube-transcript-api), captions are extracted from a given YouTube video URL.
2. **Quiz Generation:** The extracted captions are then fed into OpenAI's LLM using [`LangChain Python`](https://python.langchain.com/) with a predefined prompt template. The model generates questions based on the content, turning the video's key points into an interactive quiz.
3. **Streamlit Integration:** The quizzes are seamlessly integrated and displayed in a Streamlit app, providing users with a unique and interactive experience.

This project was developed as an entry for the [Streamlit Hackathon in September 2023](https://streamlit.io/community/llm-hackathon-2023).
